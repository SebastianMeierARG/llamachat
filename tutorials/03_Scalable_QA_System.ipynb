Armed with statistics form the Elodis Community Health Center, the citizens pointed toward an unusually high rate of cancer, neurological diseases, birth defects and respiratory illness.   They asked that the City Council approach the Kronos government to address the issues.

Today the POK has grown under the charismatic leadership of Elian Karel to loosely organized group with an estimated membership of 200-300 people.\\nThis report summarizes the history of the POK and assesses the likely future of the group.\\n\\nThe POK as a Grassroots Movement (1997-2001)\\nThe protectors of Kronos emerged from the Elodis township, a rural agricultural town of about 6500 persons that lies 25 km from Abila, capital city of Kronos.  The people of Elodis are primarily engaged in floodplain farming which is dependent upon the Tiskele River for irrigation.  In early 1997, citizens of Elodis began to be concerned about an abnormal increase in the occurrence of illnesses such as cancer, birth defects, respiratory illnesses, and neurological diseases, in addition to a marked decrease in crop yield.

When the Elodis City Council failed to take action on the citizen’s call for investigation into possible contamination of the river, a small grassroots group of seven citizens formed with the goal of bringing their concerns to the central Kronos government.\\nThe grassroots organization coalesced under the leadership of Henk Bodrogi, a floodplain farmer who had joined the group after his wife had become ill with cardiopulmonary symptoms consistent with ethylene glycol contamination.  Bodrogi was a popular local figure who was well regarded for his leadership in civic groups.  Although he had served in the Kronosian military, Bodrogi lacked experience in dealing with the Kronosian government and for which he turned to his lifelong friend, Carmine Osvaldo.

The group chose the name “Protectors of Kronos” and developed a logo consisting of an open right hand rising from the land on a black background.  Additionally, Osvaldo contacted Wellness for All (WFA), an international agency that specialized in providing clean water for rural communities.  WFA tested water from the Tiskele River both upstream and downstream of the Tiskele Bend gas fields and confirmed the presence of contaminants consistent with pollution from Hyper Acidic Substrate Removal, a gas drilling technique employed by GAStech at the Tiskele Bend fields.

To accomplish its goals, a social movement needs to win over the neutrality, sympathies, opinions, and even support of an increasingly larger majority of the populace and involve many of them in the process of opposition and change.

The majority stage is a long process of eroding the social, political, and economic supports that enable the powerholders to continue their policies.\\nMovements can also cease to exist, most commonly when a movement’s central cause has been addressed.  Movements may also end due to internal factors such as failure to adapt political agendas to changing contexts or concerns of members, or internal conflicts over politics and power.  Other reasons for movements to cease include systematic suppression by external forces that dissipate actors and make action impossible.  This can include targeted harassment and killing of key activists, and campaigns to discredit visible leaders.  While repression can suppress a social movement, it may make militancy more likely if it suppresses moderate alternatives, radicalizes remaining supporters, and creates martyrs and myths that militants use to justify their actions.\\nIn the context of the lifecycle of a social movement, the authors see three possible futures for the POK: dissolution, consolidation into a political entity, or radicalization.  \", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 8, '_split_overlap': [{'doc_id': '2e9626a868c5d7de0e7b8b7505455676', 'range': (0, 234)}, {'doc_id': '80245cf8e417f7cb78d4b7ffa51e7510', 'range': (1152, 1329)}]}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': 'bc872d3c414ecbd3b230402955fe5d8b'}>,\n",
