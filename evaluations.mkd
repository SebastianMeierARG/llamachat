# Implementation

887 = corpus documents
3924 = text after chunking

# Embeddings

Chose the right model to compute embedding is critical as embeddings links documents to LLM. More on this https://medium.com/@ryanntk/choosing-the-right-embedding-model-a-guide-for-llm-applications-7a60180d28e3

Tuvo gran impacto a la precisión. También cambiaron el contenido de las respuestas probablemente por una mejora de la vectorización del corpus y la query.
